          <p><strong>Top Tip: </strong>If you overrun your block by even 1 minute, you have worked overtime.
            You can request compensation in the app under:
            <em>Help → Contact us → Something else → Other question</em>.
          </p>

          <p>When contacting support, provide the <strong>date and time of your shift</strong> and state that you
            worked beyond the allotted time.</p>

          <p><strong>Copy &amp; paste message to send (fill in the date and time yourself) :</strong></p>
          <div class="tip">
            <blockquote>
              Hello,<br>
              Regarding my block on [DATE] starting at [TIME].<br>
              I worked beyond the scheduled block time and would like to request compensation for the additional time
              worked.<br>
              Thank you.
            </blockquote>
          </div>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Excessive Mileage: </strong>There are certain distances that Amazon considers excessive mileage, and you can claim for them. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a specific threshold — it varies depending on your shift type. In practice, it often comes down to what you feel is excessive rather than a set rule.</li>
          <li><strong>Safe:</strong> cake</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h2">Issues/Fixes</h2>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Generally:</strong> Most issues can’t really be solved on your own and will require contacting
            driver support. That said, try to avoid contacting them unless you absolutely have to — it often slows you
            down calling them so often.</li>
          <li><strong>Apps not working frozen or on a blank screen:</strong> Close the app and reopen itß, this normally
            refreshes the app if not you can go into the app settings of your device and force close the app. If you
            have really broken it instead of reinstalling the app you can go into the app settigns and clear the data
            for the app this works the same as uninstalling. </li>
          <li><strong>Outside the delivery zone:</strong>
            If possible, deliver directly to the customer and then move into the delivery zone to complete the delivery.
            Sometimes the zone will adjust if you are just outside it, but this is hit and miss.
            If you cannot deliver directly to the customer, or safely without needing a photo, contact support.
            They can unlock the geofence — after that, you’ll need to close and reopen the app(Maybe a few times) before
            yo'll see the moveable zone.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Not getting shifts:</strong>
            This is not a bug it's a feature — only joking(kinda). The problem is that there are far more drivers than
            shifts.
            That’s in Amazon’s interest, but it makes things tough for us.
            The best you can do is follow my <a href="shifts.html">How to Find Shifts</a> guide.
