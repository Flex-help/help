<h2 class="h2">Tips:</h2>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Place a sign on your dashboard to tell parking wardens you are delivering/Amazon. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFlexDrivers/comments/156vq2b/i_made_a_sign_for_dashboardsrear_windshields_use/">A simple sign you can use here.</a></li>
  <li>Stop as close to the address as possible without blocking traffic or creating a hazard. You may stop on the road if other drivers can still pass safely, but never stop on a bend or anywhere visibility is restricted.</li>
  <li>On narrow roads where only one vehicle can pass, it may be acceptable to stop briefly to deliver a parcel if the road is quiet. However, you will still be blocking traffic, so be prepared for other drivers to sound their horn or show impatience.</li>
  <li>You may park on double yellow lines without yellow kerb markings to load or unload your vehicle, usually for up to 20 minutes. If there are single yellow kerb markings alongside double yellow lines, loading is only allowed at specific times (shown on nearby signs). Loading is not permitted where there are double yellow kerb markings.</li>
  <li>In paid, residential-only, or restricted parking areas (such as private car parks or permit zones), you can usually stop briefly to make a delivery. Aim to keep it to around 5–10 minutes. In many places you may get away with up to 20 minutes, but keeping it short is safest.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Quick Tips</h2>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Be quick and get gone.</li>
  <li>Dont block any high traffic ares.</li>
  <li>Keep yourself and your vheicle safe.</li>
</ul>
