<h2 class="h2">Before you start</h2>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Bring your physical driving licence to every shift, especially at Logistics and Fresh warehouse hubs.</li>
  <li>Phone mount + high-output charger: A strong in-car charger or high-wattage battery bank is essential. The Flex app drains your phone battery quickly, so keep reliable power available at all times.</li>
  <li>Be careful when booking back-to-back shifts on your first day — you may run over your scheduled time.</li>
  <li>If you’re not sure where to go or what to do, just ask. Drivers waiting in their cars outside Logistics or Fresh hubs are usually just waiting for their shifts to begin.</li>
  <li>Annoyingly, even though there are toilet facilities at every warehouse, don’t expect to be allowed to use them. For whatever reason, staff often do their best to stop drivers from using them — so make sure you go before you arrive. If you really need to go, there’s usually a McDonald’s or bar nearby you can use.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 class="h2">Genral Tips</h2>
<ul class="list">
  <li>If the load you’ve been given doesn’t fit, pack in as much as you can and ask for larger items to be taken off your route. FYI: your rear-view mirror can legally be blocked, so you’re allowed to stack parcels up to the ceiling — just make sure they’re secure and won’t fall on you under heavy braking.</li>
  <li>Bottled water is often provided at logistics warehouses, and staff are usually happy to give you a few extra bottles if you ask.</li>
  <li>Some facilities provide head torches, but they are rarely available. If you’re working in the evenings or early mornings, it’s worth getting a powerful torch with a focus lens. These are very useful for locating house numbers, which are often almost invisible in the dark.</li>
  <li>Tolls are not subsidised. Avoid toll roads unless you’re willing to pay out of your own pocket. Some areas in London Amazon covers the tolls (ask for more details about your local area in groups and froums), but in most places they do not.</li>
  <li>Depending on the size of your car, you’ll likely need to put parcels on the back seats or fold them down to create more room. It’s best to have your rear seats folded flat before you arrive — that way you’re not stuck squeezing things in and reconfiguring your car halfway through loading.</li>
  <li>Fresh / Morrisons deliveries take up a lot more space than standard logistics parcels. Regular parcels can usually be stacked, and envelopes grouped together, but Amazon shopping bags are large and awkward — and they’re not recommended to be stacked.</li>
  <li>You can bring your partner, friends, or children along if you want, but they are not allowed to leave the car while you’re at the logistics warehouse. Parcels take priority, so make sure there’s still enough room to load everything properly. It’s worth doing a trial run first to see how much space your car really has before inviting passengers.</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Big Tip:</h3>
    <div class="tip">
      <p><strong>If you overrun your block by even 1 minute, you have worked overtime.</strong>  
      You can request compensation in the app under:  
      <em>Help → Contact us → Something else → Other question</em>.</p>

      <p>When contacting support, provide the <strong>date and time of your shift</strong> and state that you worked beyond the allotted time.</p>

      <p><strong>Copy &amp; paste message to send (fill in the date and time yourself) :</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        Hello,<br>
        Regarding my block on [DATE] starting at [TIME].<br>
        I worked beyond the scheduled block time and would like to request compensation for the additional time worked.<br>
        Thank you.
      </blockquote>

<h2 class="h2">First block steps</h2>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Arrive Early
    <ul>
      <li>Work out where drivers enter the warehouse or follow the Flex drviers signs, but don’t go in until a maximum of 15 minutes before your shift.</li>
      <li><strong>Morrisons / Co-op:</strong> Park as you would for a normal shopping trip.</li>
      <li>You can check in from 15 minutes before your start time, and most logistics hubs expect you to arrive about 15 minutes early.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Finding your packages
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Logistics hubs:</strong> Staff will usually direct you to a parking spot and bring a trolley to your car.</li>
        <li><strong>Morrisons / Fresh:</strong> You’ll need to go inside and locate the parcel area yourself.</li>
        <li><strong>App tip:</strong> On the <em>I’ve arrived</em> screen, pull up the details — it often tells you where the parcel area is located.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Load up; Follow the <a href="how-to-load-your-car.html">how to load your car guide.</a></li>
  <li>First stop: On the screen that says Start travel, you can tap the icon next to it to use your own navigation app. Google Maps is recommended for longer trips, especially during heavy traffic.</li>
  <li>Deliver one stop at a time. Be careful where you park — <a href="parking.html">see parking</a>.</li>
  <li>Always read the delivery notes and try to accommodate them, but never do anything you feel is wrong or unsafe — use common sense. It is normal to open porches to place a parcel inside, and this is generally expected behaviour, unless the notes specifically say otherwise.</li>
  <li>If no one is in or they are taking too long to come to the door. Place parcels in cardboard/paper rubbish bins or garden storage containers where available. If there is nowhere safe to conceal them (e.g. behind walls or bushes), use a neighbour as a last resort.</li>
  <li>Finishing your Route
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Once you’ve completed all your deliveries, you’re finished — you do not need to return to the hub or wait just go home.</li>
      <li><strong>Morrisons / Fresh:</strong> If you finish with 30 minutes or less remaining on your shift, you won’t need to return to the depot. Ignore any <em>“Acknowledge and return to depot”</em> messages, as no more work will be assigned. The app may automatically mark you as finished, or the message may simply disappear after a few minutes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Parcel Returns:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Logistics hubs:</strong> There is usually a returns bin outside the main reception area (not inside the warehouse). Larger items can normally be taken into reception. Depending on the time you return parcels, staff may sometimes ask you to take them inside the warehouse instead of leaving them in the usual returns bin.</li>
      <li><strong>Morrisons / Co-op:</strong> Ask the staff where they’d like returns to be placed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
